# Welcome to Game Foundation
Game development usually requires several basic gameplay systems that are common to most games. Developers have to spend time building and rebuilding these basic systems instead of being able to focus on whatâ€™s unique and fun about their idea.
Game Foundation provides pre-built common game systems that are flexible and extensible so that developers can focus on building unique gameplay.
