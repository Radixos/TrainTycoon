## Quick start

Before Game Foundation can be used during runtime, it has to be initialized in your code. 
The following is an example of initializing Game Foundation with the Awake method of a MonoBehaviour.

```Csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.GameFoundation;

public class MyGameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Awake()
    {
        GameFoundation.Initialize();
    }
}
```

When you initialize Game Foundation, the 'Main' and 'Wallet' inventories are automatically instantiated.

* **Tip:** To verify that Game Foundation is working and installed correctly, you can verify that the 'Main' and 'Wallet' inventories are present at startup.

```Csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.GameFoundation;

public class MyGameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Awake()
    {
        GameFoundation.Initialize();

        foreach (Inventory inventory in InventoryManager.GetInventories())
        {
            Debug.Log($"Found inventory named: {inventory.displayName}");
        }
    }
}
```

After implementing the above code, when you press Play in your game you should see a successfully installed and initialized Game Foundation with a Main inventory and a Wallet.
